            <h2>A brief Introduction about the organization</h2>
            <p id="tribute-info">
                Anonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist group that is widely known for its various DDoS
                cyber attacks
                against several governments, government institutions and government agencies, corporations, and the
                Church of
                Scientology.
                Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many online and offline
                community users
                simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain.[2][3][4] Anonymous members (known as
                Anons) can be
                distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel
                and film V for
                Vendetta.[5] However, this may not always be the case as some of the collective prefer to instead cover
                their face
                without using the well-known mask as a disguise. Some anons also opt to mask their voices through voice
                changers or
                text-to-speech programs.

            <h3>The Organization History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4chan raids (2003–2007)</strong> - The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived
                    anonymity under which users post images and comments on the
                    Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards,
                    particularly the /b/ board
                    of 4chan, dedicated to random content. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments
                    without identifying
                    the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous
                    was a single
                    individual.</li>
                <li><strong>Encyclopedia Dramatica (2004–present)</strong> -Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by
                    Sherrod DiGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to
                    livejournal, but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for parody and other
                    purposes </li>
                <li><strong>Project Chanology (2008)</strong> - Anonymous first became associated with hacktivism[b] in
                    2008 following a series of actions against the Church of
                    Scientology known as Project Chanology.</li>
                <li> <strong>2011–2012</strong> - In the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous
                    protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify.
                    Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia in
                    support of Arab Spring
                    movements.</li>
                <li><strong>2013</strong> - On 5 November 2013, Anonymous protesters gathered around the world for the
                    Million Mask March. Demonstrations were held
                    in 400 cities around the world to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night.[110] This has not been the only
                    march; there have been
                    quite a few others over the years, such as the 2015 march, which formed into a riot and went out of
                    control in London,
                    UK.</li>
